Clone the repo
open assignment.sln file in visual studio 2022
from test explorer run the tests

note: for API part i was only getting 429 conflict and because of that i was not able to execute the happy flow so i have added pseudocode for that in the same project file 
Postman part is missing because of the same reson (429 conflict)


however if i get a chance to proceed forward with the interview process then i am sure enough that i can prove my skills on api automation as well
Looking forward to 
Thank you
